        specific domain.

    Application Programming Interface (API)
        An API is a set of subroutine definitions, protocols, and tools for building
        application software. In general terms, it is a set of clearly defined methods
        of communication between various software components.

    Data set
        A data set (or dataset, although this spelling is not present in many
        contemporary dictionaries like Merriam-Webster) is a collection of data. 
        In statistics, data sets usually come from actual observations obtained 
        by sampling a statistical population, and each row corresponds to observations 
        on one element of that population. Data sets may further be generated by algorithms 
        for the purpose of testing certain kinds of software.
