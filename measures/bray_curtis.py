    Args:
        x (list): The first vector.
        y (list): The second vector.

    Returns:
        float: The Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between vectors x and y.

    Note:
        . Also known as SÃ¸rensen distance.
        . Widely used in ecology.
        . Used for comparing Probability Density Functions (FDFs)
        . Belongs to the L1 family.
        . (IMPORTANT) It seems that no matter the order of the vectors, the dissimilarity value is the same.
